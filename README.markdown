# RdioSharp

## About

RdioSharp is a .NET library for accessing the [Rdio API](http://developer.rdio.com/), using OAuth. Major props to [Shannon Whitley's blog post about Twitter and OAuth](http://goo.gl/WdHzi) for helping me figure out some no-nonsense, no-bloat ways to connect and authorize via OAuth.

Function names and objects will follow Rdio's API specs for [methods](http://developer.rdio.com/docs/read/rest/methods) and [object types](http://developer.rdio.com/docs/read/rest/types) as closely as possible, making this a (hopefully) easy-to-use library.

## Notes

I've been developing this with the .NET Framework v4.0, so it's the bee's knees; just know I haven't tested it with anything older yet. I will. I promise.

Also, this is a shining example of work-in-progress. You have been warned.

## Requirements

 * patience for me

## Usage

*Coming soon*. I'll be implementing test cases in the `RdioSharpTest` class, too, which ought to help with real-world usage examples.
	
## Version history

Because you all care.

 * **Version 0.1**: Initial release. Includes a couple of data models, unauthenticated API call logic, and one call.
